# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data.

## Applications

Machine learning has numerous applications including:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial fraud detection

## Popular Algorithms

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Neural Networks
6. K-Means Clustering
7. Principal Component Analysis

## Future Directions

The field of machine learning continues to evolve with advances in:
- Transfer learning
- Federated learning
- Explainable AI
- Quantum machine learning
- Edge AI deployment
